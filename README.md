# VolScript
A shell script for automated processing. A generic report will be created at the end. This is also intended to run the kitchen sink of Volatility commands and save the output into a new folder.
No variables are needed. Just place a copy of the script in the same directory as your RAM capture.
This script assumes you are using a ramdisk or a fast scratch location and will copy to that location.
